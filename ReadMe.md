## Using the Location Search

To use the search feature: type the location you are intended, the search bar will provide top 5 suggestions from which you can select the preferred location. The webpage will pinpoint the selected location on the map

To reset the search: click the **Clear** button.

### How the Search feature works

The search feature uses AutoSuggest module of Bing Maps API. So, when anything is typed in Search bar, AutoSuggest module is used to get the suggested locations. Once the location is selected from the suggestions, a pushpin is created on that location on the map.

The clear button clears any existing search as well as pushpins on the map.
